        <h3>Notes from reading:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>From the office hours video-- Event listeners are better practice than onClick.</li>
            <li>If you use ID instead of Class you don't need to declare a variable in the script.</li>
            <li></li>
            <li>Objects are the 'who' (user, name, age, etc) An object in JavaScript is a self-contained set of related values and functions.</li>
            <li>Methods (functions) are the what/actions (do something) </li>
            <li>"this" in methods are used to access information stored within the object. (this.name) </li>
            <li>In JavaScript, keyword 'this' behaves unlike most other programming languages. It can be used in any function, even if it's not a method of an object.</li>
            <li>In non-strict mode the value of this in such case will be the global object (window in a browser, we'll get to it later in the chapter Global object). This is a historical behavior that "use strict" fixes.</li>
            <li>Arrow functions are special: they don't have their “own” this. If we reference this from such a function, it's taken from the outer “normal” function.</li>
            <li>Functions that are stored in object properties are called “methods”.</li>
            <li>Methods allow objects to “act” like <code>object.doSomething()</code>.</li>
            <li>Methods can reference the object as <code>this</code>.</li>
            <li>The value of <code>this</code> is defined at run-time.</li>
            <li>When a function is declared, it may use <code>this</code>, but that <code>this</code> has no value until the function is called.</li>
            <li>A function can be copied between objects.</li>
            <li>When a function is called in the “method” syntax: <code>object.method()</code>, the value of <code>this</code> during the call is <code>object</code>.</li>
            <li>Please note that arrow functions are special: they have no <code>this</code>. When <code>this</code> is accessed inside an arrow function, it is taken from outside.</li>
            <li></li>
            <li>If a property's name doesn't follow the rules for naming variables described in Chapter 2, it needs to be quoted. The property 'real name' in the example above needs to be quoted because it contains a space.</li>
            <li>The object literal notation is the preferred way of creating objects.</li>
            <li>You can access the properties of an object using the dot notation. You can also access an object's properties using bracket notation</li>
            <li>The ability to create objects with computed property keys was introduced in ES6. This means that JavaScript code can be placed inside square brackets and the property key will be the return value of that code. </li>
            <li>Calling a method is the same as invoking a function, so parentheses need to be placed after the method name:</li>
            <li>Method called hasOwnProperty(). This can be used to check whether an object has a property that is its own, rather than one that has been inherited from another object:</li>
            <li>There are lots of ways to iterate through an object. </li>
            <li>An object is not an ordered list like an array, set or map, so you should never rely on the properties being in a certain order.</li>
            <li>Any property can be removed from an object using the delete operator. </li>
            <li>It's even possible for an object to contain other objects.</li>
            <li>Objects are assigned by reference. This means that if a variable is assigned to an object that already exists, it will simply point to the exact same space in memory.</li>
            <li>An object literal can be passed as a parameter to a function. This is useful when there are a large number of parameters, as it allows the arguments to be provided by name and in any order. This means you don't have to remember the order to enter them when invoking a function.</li>
            <li>A solution to this problem is to use the object literal pattern to create a namespace for groups of related functions. This is done by creating an object literal that serves as the namespace, then adding any values as properties of that object, and any functions as methods.</li>
            <li>The parse() method takes a string of data in JSON format and returns a JavaScript object:</li>
            <li>The stringify() method does the opposite, taking a JavaScript object and returning a string of JSON data, as can be seen in the example:</li>
            <li>The Math.ceil() method will round a number up to the next integer, or remain the same if it is already an integer:</li>
            <li>The Math.floor() method will round a number down to the next integer, or remain the same if it is already an integer</li>
            <li>The Math.round() method will round a number to the nearest integer:</li>
            <li>The Math.trunc() method that returns the integer-part of a number – that is, it gets truncated at the decimal point:</li>
            <li>Math.pow(27, 1/3); // A nice way to do cube roots</li>
            <li>This is a good source for the math.methods <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_math.asp" target="_blank"> Math Methods</a></li>
            <li>Be careful if you require exact answers to these calculations, as rounding errors in the background mean the returned value is often slightly inaccurate.</li>
            <li>This is a good source for date.methods <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_date_methods.asp" target="_blank" >Date Methods</a></li>
            <li>Remember that computer programs start counting at zero, so January is 0, February is 1, and so on up to December, which is 11.</li>
            <li>A regular expression (or RegExp, for short) is a pattern that can be used to search strings for matches to the pattern. A common use is 'find and replace' type operations. For example, say you were looking for any word ending in 'ing', you could use the regular expression /[a-zA-Z]+ing$/.</li>
            <li>Here is a regex tester. <a href="https://regex101.com/" target="_blank">regex101</a></li>
            <li>Oy Vey. RegEx is a killer. My brain has always struggled with it.  Again, Oy vey. </li>
            <li>Special Characters
                In a regular expression, there are a number of characters that have a special meaning, commonly known as metacharacters:
                
                . matches any character, except line breaks
                
                \w matches any word character, and is equivalent to [A-Za-z0-9_]
                
                \W matches any non-word character, and is equivalent to [\^A-Za-z0-9_]
                
                \d matches any digit character, and is equivalent to [0-9]
                
                \D matches any non-digit character, and is equivalent to [^0-9]
                
                \s matches any whitespace character, and is equivalent to [ \t\r\n\f]
                
                \S matches any non-whitespace character, and is equivalent to [^ \t\r\n\f]
                
                Modifiers
                Modifiers can be placed after a token to deal with multiple occurrences of that token:
                
                ? makes the preceding token in the regular expression optional
                
                * matches one or more occurrences of the preceding token
                
                + matches one or more occurrences of the preceding token
                
                {n} matches n occurrences of the preceding token
                
                {n,} matches at least n occurrences of the pattern
                
                {,m} matches at most m occurrences of the preceding token
                
                {n,m} matches at least n and at most m occurrences of the preceding token
                
                ^ marks the position immediately before the first character in the string
                
                $ marks the position immediately after the last character in the string
                
                Any special characters or modifiers can be escaped using a backslash. So if you wanted to match a question mark, ?, you would need to use the regular expression /\?/.</li>
            <li></li>    
            <li>The Document Object Model (DOM) allows you to access elements of a web page and enable interaction with the page by adding and removing elements, changing the order, content and attributes of elements, and even altering how they are styled.</li>
            <li>In the console:  we can use the nodeType property to find out what type of node it is:</li>
            <li>Every id attribute should be unique to just one element (Make sure you follow this rule : it's not enforced by the HTML parser, but odd things can happen in your code if you have more than one element with the same ID)</li>
            <li>If there are no elements in the document with the given tag name, an empty node list is returned.</li>
            <li>The document.querySelector() method allows you to use CSS notation to find the first element in the document that matches that matches a CSS selector provided as an argument.</li>
            <li>he document.querySelectorAll() method also uses CSS notation but returns a node list of all the elements in the document that match the CSS query selector.</li>   
            <li>Observation: Double Check that the DOM item is supported if you are designing for older Internet Explorer devices.</li>
            <li>The setAttribute can change the value of an element's attributes. It takes two arguments: the attribute that you wish to change, and the new value of that attribute.</li>
            <li>The power of the innerHTML property becomes even more apparent if you want to insert a large amount of HTML into the document. Instead of creating each element and text node individually, you can simply enter the raw HTML as a string.</li>
            <li>One particularly useful CSS property often employed is the display property. This can be used to make elements disappear and reappear on the page as needed:</li>
            <li></li>
            <li>Events are another part of the DOM and they are what provides the link between the web page and user interactions. Every time a user interacts with a web page, such as clicking on a link, pressing a key, or moving a mouse, an event occurs that our program can detect and then respond to.</li>
            <li>The click event occurs when a user clicks with the mouse, presses the Enter key, or taps the screen, making it a very useful all-round event covering many types of interaction.</li>
            <li>Avoid inline event listeners.</li>
            <li>The addEventListener() method is called on a node object, the node to which the event listener is being applied. </li>
            <li>The parameter does not have to be called event. It can be given any legal variable name, although calling it event can make it easier to read the code. Many developers often abbreviate it to just e.</li>
            <li>There are several types of events, ranging from when a video has finished playing to when a resource has completed downloading. You can see a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events" target="_blank">  full list on the Events page of the Mozilla Developer Network.</a></li>
            <li>It's important to support mouse events as well as touch events, so non-touch devices are also supported. </li>
            <li>There are no 'swipe' events. These need to be created by using a combination of touchstart, touchmove, and touchleave events that monitor the distance and direction moved from start to finish of a touch event.</li>
            <li>An event listener can be removed using the removeEventListener() method. </li>
