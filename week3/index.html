        <h3>Notes from reading:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>From the office hours video-- Event listeners are better practice than onClick.</li>
            <li>If you use ID instead of Class you don't need to declare a variable in the script.</li>
            <li></li>
            <li>Objects are the 'who' (user, name, age, etc)</li>
            <li>Methods (functions) are the what/actions (do something) </li>
            <li>"this" in methods are used to access information stored within the object. (this.name) </li>
            <li>In JavaScript, keyword 'this' behaves unlike most other programming languages. It can be used in any function, even if it's not a method of an object.</li>
            <li>In non-strict mode the value of this in such case will be the global object (window in a browser, we'll get to it later in the chapter Global object). This is a historical behavior that "use strict" fixes.</li>
            <li>Arrow functions are special: they don't have their “own” this. If we reference this from such a function, it's taken from the outer “normal” function.</li>
            <li>Functions that are stored in object properties are called “methods”.</li>
            <li>Methods allow objects to “act” like <code>object.doSomething()</code>.</li>
            <li>Methods can reference the object as <code>this</code>.</li>
            <li>The value of <code>this</code> is defined at run-time.</li>
            <li>When a function is declared, it may use <code>this</code>, but that <code>this</code> has no value until the function is called.</li>
            <li>A function can be copied between objects.</li>
            <li>When a function is called in the “method” syntax: <code>object.method()</code>, the value of <code>this</code> during the call is <code>object</code>.</li>
            <li>Please note that arrow functions are special: they have no <code>this</code>. When <code>this</code> is accessed inside an arrow function, it is taken from outside.</li>
            <li></li>
