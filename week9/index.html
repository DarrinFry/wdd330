        <h3>Notes from reading:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Every JavaScript environment has a global object. Any variables that are created in the global scope are actually properties of this object, and any functions are methods of it. In a browser environment the global object is the window object, which represents the browser window that contains a web page.</li>
            <li>The Browser Object Model (or BOM for short) is a collection of properties and methods that contain information about the browser and computer screen. </li>
            <li>Every browser window, tab, popup, frame, and iframe has a window object.</li>
            <li>BOM only works in browser environments. Javascript works in other places but BOM will not.</li>
            <li>Global variables can be accessed in all parts of the program.</li>
            <li>The window.alert() method will pause the execution of the program and display a message in a dialog box. The message is provided as an argument to the method, and undefined is always returned:</li>
            <li>The window.confirm() method will stop the execution of the program and display a confirmation dialog that shows the message provided as an argument, and giving the options of OK or Cancel. It returns the boolean values of true if the user clicks OK, and false if the user clicks Cancel:</li>
            <li>The window.prompt() method will stop the execution of the program. It displays a dialog that shows a message provided as an argument, as well as an input field that allows the user to enter text. This text is then returned as a string when the user clicks OK. If the user clicks Cancel, null is returned:</li>
            <li>It’s also worth keeping in mind that most browsers allow users to disable any dialogs from repeatedly appearing, meaning they are not a feature to be relied upon.</li>
            <li>The window object has a navigator property that returns a reference to the Navigator object. The Navigator object contains information about the browser being used. Its userAgent property will return information about the browser and operating system being used.</li>
            <li>The window.location property is an object that contains information about the URL of the current page. It contains a number of properties that provide information about different fragments of the URL.

                The href property returns the full URL as a string:</li>
            <li>The origin property returns a string that shows the protocol and domain where the current page originated from. This property is read-only, so cannot be changed:</li>
            <li>The window.history property can be used to access information about any previously visited pages in the current browser session. </li>
            <li>The window.history.go() method can be used to go to a specific page, where 0 is the current page:</li>
            <li>There are also the window.history.forward() and window.history.back() methods that can be used to navigate forwards and backwards by one page respectively, just like using the browser’s forward and back buttons.</li>
            <li>A new window can be opened using the window.open() method. This takes the URL of the page to be opened as its first parameter, the window title as its second parameter, and a list of attributes as the third parameter. This can also be assigned to a variable, so the window can then be referenced later in the code:
                const popup = window.open('https://sitepoint.com','
                SitePoint','width=400,height=400,resizable=yes');</li>
            <li>The window.screen object contains information about the screen the browser is displayed on. You can find out the height and width of the screen in pixels using the height and width properties respectively:</li>
            <li>Many of the methods and properties covered in the previous section were abused in the past for dubious activities such as user-agent sniffing, or detecting screen dimensions to decide whether or not to display certain elements. These practices have (thankfully) now been superseded by better practices, such as media queries and feature detection,</li>
            <li>Each window object contains a document object. This object has properties and methods that deal with the page that has been loaded into the window.</li>
            <li>The document.write() method can also be used within a document inside script tags to inject a string into the markup. This will not overwrite the rest of the HTML on the page.</li>
            <li>Cookies are also limited to storing up to 4KB of data, although 20 cookies are allowed per domain, which can add up to quite a lot of data.</li>
            <li>Cookies can be used for personalizing a user’s browsing experience, storing user preferences, keeping track of user choices (such as a shopping cart), authentication and tracking users. </li>
            <li>Cookies take the form of a text file that contain a list of name/value pairs separated by semicolons.</li>
            <li>To create a cookie, you assign it to JavaScript’s “cookie jar”, using the document.cookie property, like so:</li>
            <li>The document.cookie property acts like a special type of string. Assigning another cookie to it won’t overwrite the entire property, it will just append it to the end of the string. So we can add more cookies by assigning them to document.cookie:</li>
            <li>A cookie’s value can be changed by reassigning it to document.cookie using the same name but a different value. </li>
            <li>Cookies are session cookies by default. This means they are deleted once a browser session is finished (when the user closes the browser tab or window).</li>
            <li>Cookies can be made persistent ― that is, lasting beyond the browser session ― by adding "; expires=date" to the end of the cookie when it’s set, where date is a date value in the UTC String format Day, DD-Mon-YYYY HH:MM:SS GMT.</li>
            <li>const expiryDate = new Date(); 
                const tomorrow = expiryDate.getTime() + 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24;
                expiryDate.setTime(tomorrow);
                
                document.cookie = `name=Batman; expires=${ expiryDate.toUTCString()}`;</li>
            <li>Applications that contain sensitive information shouldn’t rely on cookies expiring using these methods. Browsers can sometimes hold on to information stored in a cookie that should have expired when the “session restore” feature is used after a crash.</li>
            <li>Adding the string ; secure to the end of a cookie will ensure it’s only transmitted over a secure HTTPS network:</li>
            <li>To remove a cookie, you need to set it to expire at a time in the past:

                Copy
                document.cookie = 'name=Batman; expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:01 GMT';
                If a cookie is a session cookie, it will expire when the tab or window is closed.</li>
            <li>The window.setTimeout() method accepts a callback to a function as its first parameter and a number of milliseconds as its second parameter.</li>
            <li>The window.setInterval() method works in a similar way to window.setTimeout(), except that it will repeatedly invoke the callback function after every given number of milliseconds.</li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
            <li>The data- attribute is a way of embedding data in a web page using custom attributes that are ignored by the browser. They’re also private to a page, so are not intended to be used by an external service – their sole purpose is to be used by a JavaScript program. </li>
            <li>The names of these attributes can be decided by the developer, but they must use the following format:

                Start with data-.
                
                Contain only lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, dots, colons or underscores.
                
                Include an optional string value.</li>
            <li>Data attributes provide a convenient way of adding data directly into the HTML markup, enabling a richer user experience. More information about data attributes can be found in <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/how-why-use-html5-custom-data-attributes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> this post on SitePoint.</a></li>
            <li>The Web Storage API provides a key-value store on the client’s computer that is similar to using cookies but has fewer restrictions, more storage capacity, and is generally easier to use.</li>
            <li>If a browser supports the Web Storage API, the window object will have a property called localStorage, which is a native object with a number of properties and methods used to store data.</li>
            <li>localStorage.setItem('name', 'Walter White');</li>
            <li>localStorage.getItem('name');</li>
            <li>Rather than using the getItem() and setItem() methods, assignment can be used instead. In the next example, we simply reference localStorage.name as if it was a variable to change its value:</li>
            <li>Every time a value is saved to local storage, a storage event is fired. Note that this event is only fired on any other windows or tabs from the same domain, and only if the value of the item being saved changes. </li>
            <li>The fact that only strings can be saved might seem like a restriction at first, but by using JSON, we can store any JavaScript object in local storage. </li>
            <li>localStorage.setItem('superman', JSON.stringify(hero);</li>
            <li>superman = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('superman'));</li>
            <li>The Geolocation API is used to obtain the geographical position of the device. This means it can be used to find the user’s exact location, then link to nearby places or measure the speed at which the user is moving. </li>
            <li>Because of privacy concerns, permission to use this has to be granted by the user first.</li>
            <li>JavaScript is a single-threaded language, meaning that only one process can run at one time. Web workers allow processes to be run in the background, adding support for concurrency in JavaScript.</li>
            <li>To get started, use the Worker() constructor function to create a new worker:

                const worker = new Worker('task.js');</li>
            <li>At the time of writing, the Chrome browser won't let you run workers from local files like this. A workaround is start Chrome using the --allow-file-access-from-files flag, or simply use a different browser for this example.</li>
            <li>The Service Worker API allows a worker script to run in the background with the added benefit of being able to intercept network requests. </li>
            <li>Websocket is a new protocol that allows two-way communication with a server – also known as push messaging. This means that a connection is kept open and responses are ‘pushed’ to the client as soon as they are received.</li>
            <li>HTML5 introduced the <audio> and <video> tags used to insert audio and video clips into a web page. It also introduced a Media API for controlling the playback of the clips using JavaScript.</li>
