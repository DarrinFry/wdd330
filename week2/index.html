        <h3>Notes from reading:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>~~~~~~PROGRAMING BASICS~~~~~~</li>
            <li>RESERVED WORDS:abstract, await, boolean, break, byte, case, catch, char, class, const, continue, debugger, default, delete, do, double, else, enum, export, extends, false, final, finally, float, for, function, goto, if, implements, import, in instanceof, int, interface, let, long, native, new, null, package, private, protected, public, return, short, static, super, switch, synchronized, this, throw, throws, transient, true, try, typeof, var, volatile, void, while, with, yield</li>
            <li>Not reserved, but you still shouldn't use for variables etc.: undefined, NaN, Infinity.</li>
            <li>Primitive Data Types: String, Symbol, Number, Boolean, Undefined, Null, and Objects</li>
            <li>Variable declaration "const" is used when the variable will not ne reassigned to another value.</li>
            <li>Variable declaration "let" is used if the variable might be reassigned later in the program.</li>
            <li>If the variable references a non-primitive data type, such as an array, function or object, then using const will not make it immutable. This means the underlying data inside the object can change (known as mutating the object)</li>
            <li>The variable declaration of 'var" was used in older versions. However, you should use "let" now.</li>
            <li>ES6 standard you can use blocks { } anything inside the block has local scope. </li>
            <li>Constant and variable names are case sensitive.</li>
            <li>A useful way to distinguish between a property and a method ― methods end with parentheses.</li>
            <li>Template Literals: use the backtick character, `, to deliminate the string and insert variables ${ variable }</li>
            <li>Symbols: can be used to create unique values, which helps to avoid any naming collisions. The main use-case for symbols is as object property keys. Study this for more info: <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/es6-symbols-uses/" target="_blank "> Sitepoint Article on Symbols</a> </li>
            <li>If a number starts with a 0x, it is considered to be in hexadecimal (base 16) notation</li>
            <li>If a number starts with a zero, followed by the letter o, then it is considered to be in octal (base 8) notation</li>
            <li>If a number starts with a zero, followed by the letter b then it is considered to be in binary (base 2) notation:</li>
            <li>Infinity is a special error value in JavaScript that is used to represent any number that is too big for the language to deal with. The biggest number that JavaScript can handle is 1.7976931348623157e+308</li>
            <li>Only 9 values are always false and these are known as falsy values:
                * "" // double quoted empty string literal
                * '' // single quoted empty string literal
                * `` // empty template literal
                * 0
                * -0 // considered different to 0 by JavaScript!
                * NaN
                * false
                * null
                * undefined</li>
            <li>~~~~~ARRAY, LOGIC, and LOOPS~~~~~~</li>
            <li>Preferred method of creating an array is the array literal " const myArray = []; " </li> 
            <li>Arrays can have a variety of item types inside them.</li>
            <li>Destructuring an array is the concept of taking values out of an array and presenting them as individual values. Destructuring allows us to assign multiple values at the same time, using arrays: const [x,y] = [1,2];</li>
            <li>"pop()" removes and returns the last: "shift() removes and returns the first.</li>   
            <li>"push()" adds a new value to the end: "unshift() adds a new value to the beginning. </li>
            <li>Multidimensional arrays use a coordinate system.</li>
            <li>set() is a great way to eliminate duplicate values.</li>
            <li>set() can be converted into an array by using the spread operator or the Array.from() method.</li>
            <li>Maps can have any kind of data type for key:value</li>
            <li>To better understand Javascript MAPS I used this  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMfMdE3wifs">video</a></li>
            <li>~~~~~~FUNCTIONS~~~~~~</li>
            <li>Keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)</li>
            <li>Remember: you need parentheses to invoke a function. </li>
            <li>If you don't return a value, it will return undefined by default.</li>
            <li>Any parameters a function needs are set when the function is defined. When a function is invoked, it is provided with arguments.</li>    
            <li>Be aware of rounding errors.</li>
            <li>The rest operator (...args) can be used to deal with multiple arguments by creating an array of arguments that are available inside the body of the function.</li>
            <li>Default values should always come after non-default values.</li>
            <li>Arrow Functions:The parameters come before the arrow and the main body of the function comes after. Arrow functions are always anonymous, so if you want to refer to them, you must assign them to a variable. </li>
            <li>Arrow Functions: IF the function does not require any parameters, a pair of empty parentheses mus go before the arrow.</li>
            <li>Functions that are defined using a function declaration are automatically hoisted, meaning they can be invoked before they have been defined.</li>
            <li>The callback is provided as a parameter, then invoked inside the body of the function.</li>
            <li>efactoring code ― the functionality of the application remains the same, but the underlying code has become more flexible and easier to maintain, as well as being more readable and descriptive due to the use of functions.</li>
