        <h3>Notes from reading:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>System error ― there's a problem with the system or external devices with which the program is interacting.</li>
            <li>Programmer error ― the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it could even be as simple as a typo.</li>
            <li>User error ― the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is unable to handle.</li>
            <li>It might even be argued that user errors are in fact also programmer errors, because the program should be designed in a way that prevents the user from making the error.</li>
            <li>An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program to deal with the error. </li>
            <li>An exception will also produce a stack trace. This is a sequence of functions or method calls that lead to the point where the error occurred.</li>
            <li>A warning can occur if there's an error in the code that isn't enough to cause the program to crash. This means the program will continue to run after a warning.</li>
            <li>When a runtime error occurs in the browser, the HTML will still appear, but the JavaScript code will stop working in the background, which isn't always obvious at first. If a warning occurs, the JavaScript will continue to run (although possibly incorrectly).</li>
            <li>A strict mode that produces more exceptions and warnings and prohibits the use of some deprecated features. This is due to the fact that strict mode considers coding practices that were previously accepted as just being 'poor style' as actual errors.</li>
            <li>Not using strict mode is often referred to as 'sloppy mode' as it's forgiving of sloppy programming practices. Strict mode encourages a better quality of JavaScript to be written that befits a ninja programmer, so its use is recommended.</li>
            <li>You can even use strict mode on a per-function basis by adding the line inside a function. Strict mode will then only be applied to anything inside that function:</li>
            <li>n fact, the recommended way to invoke strict mode is to place all your code into a self-invoking function (covered in more detail in Chapter 12), like so:
                (function() {
                    'use strict';
                
                    // All your code would go inside this function
                
                }());</li>
            <li>Function expressions can be made "self-invoking".

                A self-invoking expression is invoked (started) automatically, without being called.
                
                Function expressions will execute automatically if the expression is followed by ().
                
                You cannot self-invoke a function declaration.
                
                You have to add parentheses around the function to indicate that it is a function expression:</li>

            <li>The recommended way to determine browser support for a feature is to use feature detection.</li>
            <li>Debugging is the process of finding out where bugs occur in the code and then dealing with them.</li>
            <li>The most basic form of debugging is to use the alert() method to show a dialog at certain points in the code. Because alert() stops a program from running until OK is clicked, it allows us to effectively put breakpoints in the code that let us check the value of variables at that point to see if they're what we expect them to be. </li>
            <li>One of the most useful commands is the debugger keyword. This will create a breakpoint in your code that will pause the execution of the code and allow you to see where the program is currently up to</li>
            <li>Remember to remove any references to the debugger command before shipping any code, otherwise the program will appear to freeze when people try to use it!</li>
