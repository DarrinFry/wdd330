        <h3>Notes from reading:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Forms are made up of a <form> element that contains form controls such as input fields, select menus and buttons. These input fields can be populated with information that is processed once the form has been submitted.</li>
            <li>Each form control has an initial value that can be specified in the HTML code. This value can be changed by a user entering information or interacting with the form's interface (such as using a slider to increase or decrease a value). The value can also be changed dynamically using JavaScript.</li>
            <li>The legacy DOM had a useful property called document.forms that returns an HTML collection of all the forms in the document in the order they appear in the markup. </li>
            <li>square bracket notation can be used (this is also required if the form's name attribute contains any invalid characters, such as spaces or dashes):  const form = document.forms['search'];</li>
            <li>The form.reset() method will reset all the form controls back to their initial values specified in the HTML.</li>
            <li>Reset buttons are generally considered poor for usability, as they are too easy to click and then wipe out all the data that's been entered. So think very carefully before using one in a form.</li>
            <li>The focus event occurs when an element is focused on. In the case of an input element, this is when the cursor is placed inside the element (either by clicking or tapping on it or navigating to it using the keyboard).</li>
            <li>The blur event occurs when the user moves the focus away from the form element.</li>
            <li>The change event occurs when the user moves the focus away from the form element after changing it</li>
            <li>Possibly the most important form event is the submit event, occurring when the form is submitted. Usually this will send the content of the form to the server to be processed, but we can use JavaScript to intercept the form before it's sent by adding a submit event listener.</li>
            <li>preventDefault() can be used to prevent a normal action from happening. Useful if testing so it doesn't ry to send the form to the backend.</li>
            <li>The autofocus attribute give focus to this element when a page loads. </li>
            <li>Hidden fields can be created using input fields with type='hidden'. These are not displayed by the browser, but have a 'value' attribute that can contain information that is submitted with the form. They are often used to send information such as settings or information that the user has already provided.</li>
            <li>There are different types of buttons. The default type is 'submit', which is why we didn't have to specify the type in the search example.</li>
            <li>Form validation is the process of checking whether a user has entered the information into a form correctly.</li>
            <li>Validation can occur on the client side using JavaScript, and on the server side. It is advisable to use both client-side and server-side validation. </li>
