    <div>
        <h3>Notes from reading:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>It has been a few semesters since I have worked with JavaScript, so as a refresher, I read from the start of chapter 2 through the assigned reading.</li>
            <li>The information stored or shared with the user is called output. Anything coming in from where it was stored or anything the user enters is called input.</li>
            <li>In Brother Chandler's office hours video he made the comment that he will look at the application requirements and build it to fit that. Developers will sometimes split an application and build a mobile version and a desktop version (aka a lite version and a full version). </li>
            <li>In the Master Mobile UX material it tells you to design with the smallest and most simple device first. Knowing what you are designing will help you to do this.</li>
            <li>Reachability matters. Think about how your customer is using the device. Lower part of the screen is easier to access.</li>
            <li>Reduce cognitive load.</li>
            <li>In an unrelated epiphany... <a href="https://www.codingem.com/javascript-semicolon-usage/#:~:text=JavaScript%20does%20not%20require%20semicolons,Automatic%20Semicolon%20Insertion%20(ASI)" target="_blank"> Semicolons are optional</a> in some cases in JavaScript.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Questions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>How important is CSS styling for these assignments?</li>
        </ol>
